I have not much coding experience and learn from you. 
I have a project for backtest of crypto currencies.

Requirements
The main function of this program is try to understand the performance of various indicators individually. I will run this program for any cryptocurrency chart by providing the related timeframe and pair in GUI screen. It first takes data from Binance API and then it understand selected indicator or indicators and their parameters. However, each indicator should be separately visualised. That means if I selected 4 indicators, I need to get 4 different graphs indicating the buy and sell signals and 4 different tables to see breakdown of transactions for each indicator individually.

Phase of Project
I have completed many codes with GPT4.
Program has not been working right now and need to solve problems to achieve “requirements”

Expectation from GPT4
All indicators and their parameters must be designed correctly to achieve “requirements”. Missing or excess codes which are not meet the “requirements” must be fixed. All given codes by GPT must be easy to copy or replace. The new modified codes or replacement must be clearly understandable. Please use also plug-ins where necessary.
